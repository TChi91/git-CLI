Recap

Before you start doing any work, make sure to look for the project's CONTRIBUTING.md file.

Next, it's a good idea to look at the GitHub issues for the project

    look at the existing issues to see if one is similar to the change you want to contribute
    if necessary create a new issue
    communicate the changes you'd like to make to the project maintainer in the issue

When you start developing, commit all of your work on a topic branch:

    do not work on the master branch
    make sure to give the topic branch clear, descriptive name

As a general best practice for writing commits:

    make frequent, smaller commits
    use clear and descriptive commit messages
    update the README file, if necessary

Recap

A pull request is a request for the source repository to pull in your commits and merge them with their project. To create a pull request, a couple of things need to happen:

    you must fork the source repository
    clone your fork down to your machine
    make some commits (ideally on a topic branch!)
    push the commits back to your fork
    create a new pull request and choose the branch that has your new commits
